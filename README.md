#Avatar

Ethereum contract that merges the functionality of keybase and gravatar.

The root contract  (aggregator) only stores reference to individual avatar contracts, owned by their creators. Individual avatars are free to register with an arbitrary set of aggregators.

An avatar contract at its base is a store of arbitrary structured data that conforms to an existing AIP (Avatar Improvement Proposal).

All data is arbitrary and creator controlled, but conventions allow for the data to be verified out with of the blockchain.


##Avatar Improvement Proposals

Avatar Improvement Proposals (AIP) are specified in order to standardize and improve avatars in a way that allows freedom of choice, interoperability and fosters discussion.

* [AIP-0](/AIP/AIP-0.md) 
* [AIP-1](/AIP/AIP-1.md)
