#API-1

Requires: AIP-0

Contract extentions. This AIP specifies the convention of using contract addresses as values for properties.

This allows for updating the behaviour of more complicated properties without the need to recreate an Avatar. Simply by pointing a property to a new contract. This allows Avatars to support evolving AIP specifications by simply allowing property updating as per AIP-0.
